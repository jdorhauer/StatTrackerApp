                    When you create an account, you have options to enter teams and players. You can then track common statistics for each. We are currently able to help track useful data for skaters, such as goals, assists, and shooting percentage. For teams, there are options to track information for power plays, penalty kills, goals for, goals against, wins and losses and more. Check out the "Updates In Progress" to see areas we are working and ideas we have to expand the capabilities of the application.

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    Here at StatTracker, we are hockey fans first and foremost. While not all of us played professionally, we have all played recreationally and watch the sport constantly. We saw a lack of accessible resources for coaches, so we decided to build our own. The biggest benefit to that is the ability to adapt and improve. We listen to coaches and scouts and can easily update to fit the needs of our clients.

                <h2>Updates In Progress</h2>
                <p>We are constantly working to improve our product. We have a few ideas that we are currently working on bringing to the project. We want to expand to include statistics that are more specific to defensive players or goaltenders. We are also working on a new look for the application. If you have any ideas, please feel free to reach out and share those at jddorhauer@gmail.com.</p>
