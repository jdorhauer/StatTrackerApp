# StatTrackerApp

This is an ASP.NET MVC project that I designed and built. It is an application that is designed to help hockey coaches to keep track of player statistics over time. It has basic CRUD functionality. It can also sort data on the pages. Currently, it is set up to track common statistics for forwards. In the future, I plan to expand the capabilities of this application and add the ability to track more information for defensive players and goalies.
